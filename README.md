# SAW — Surpass All World

> Spatial editor bridging simulation and reality.

**The 3D world is the interface.**

Whether you're on a browser, in a headset, or piloting a robot — you're moving through the same spatial world. SAW is the lens between world models and reality.

## Status

🚧 **Phase 1: Foundation** — Building the spatial core.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Architecture

- **Spatial-first** — You're always in 3D. Panels and UI overlay the space.
- **Shell-agnostic** — Same core runs on web, headset, robot HUD.
- **Deployment modes:**
  - Sim only — pure virtual
  - Virtual on real — anchored to reality
  - Real on real — controlling actual robots

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Three.js (WebGPU-ready)
- Vite
- Vanilla — no framework lock-in
